## Prototype Design Pattern

**How to Implement**

1. Create the prototype interface and declare the `clone` method in it .

2. A prototype class must define the alternative constructor that accepts an object of that class as an argument. The
   constructor must copy the values of all fields defined in the class from the passed object into newly created
   instance. If you're changing a subclass, you must call the parent constructor to let the superclass handle cloning of
   its private fields.
   <br></br>

3. The cloning method usually consists of just one line: running a new operator with the prototypical version of the
   constructor. Note, that every class must explicitly override the cloning method and use its own class name along with
   the `new` operator. Otherwise, the cloning method may produce an object of a parent class.

4. Optionally, create a centralized prototype registry to store a catalog of frequently used prototypes. You can
   implement the registry as a new factory class or put it in the base prototype class with a static method for fetching
   the prototype. This method should search for a prototype based on search criteria that the client code passes to the
   method. The criteria might either be a simple string tag or a complex set of search parameters. After the appropriate
   prototype is found, the registry should clone it and return the copy to the client. Finally, replace the direct calls
   to the subclassesâ€™ constructors with calls to the factory method of the prototype registry.
